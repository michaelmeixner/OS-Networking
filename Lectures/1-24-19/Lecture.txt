IP address:
    a set of four hexadecimal numbers (each ranging from 0-FF) arranged as a dotted-quad number
    each IP address on a network must be unique
    DHCP servers are what devices get their IP addresses from and access the network through
    Only way to access a network is to know its IP address

    Loopback address: 127.0.0.1 (loop back, local host, home)

Another part to IP addresses:
    Port: a number assigned to anything wanting to use the network
    the OS gives the thing a port by assigning it an integer (2 bytes)
    port number comes after the IP address after a colon (#.#.#.#: #)
    the first 1024 ports have pre-assigned uses, so the OS will give out a port number higher than that to a request
    80 = http (web server port number)
    443 = https (secure web server port number)
    20, 21 = ftp (file transfer protocal)
    port numbers tell the network card which applications packets go to when they're received
    port numbers are stored by the OS itself

    ports can be used to control usage on the network
    dhcp server = port 67
    dhcp client = port 68
    can tell router to not allow access to specific port numbers
    firewalls just filter port numbers based on what they are told to allow/disallow incoming packets from
    outgoing packets are passed through firewalls

    connection chain: 
        first: DHCP server (we usually have a backup server in case one doesn't connect) gives you an IP address and a gateway address
        next: ask OS for domain of network you want to connect to. If OS doesn't know, it asks the local DNS (which it gets from the DHCP)
                if DNS doesn't know, asks ISP (internet service provider)
                if ISP doesn't know, ask InterNIC
        next: open connection from router to gateway
