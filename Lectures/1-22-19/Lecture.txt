Networks:
    "they're kinda funny things"
    they're deceptively simple
    a network is divided into layers
    the OSI model is the most common style of network - consists of seven layers
    Layers:
        Top layer: application layer
        Next layer down: transport layer (TCP/IP, UDP/IP) (Optional formatting protocals for private networks)
            TCP: (transmission control protocal)
                an established connection stays the same until the connection is closed and then established again
                lots of communication about the data being sent
                send/receive confirmations
            UDP: (user datagram protocal)
                each packet finds its own route to the destination
                no guarantee that everything makes it
                arrive out of order
                no way to know each packet made it there
                no direct connection to the server (connectionless)
                uses a lot less bandwidth, no need to establish connection, potentially faster
                good for small packets of data that are complete in themselves (i.e. text messages)
                used for DNS (domain name service)
                    InterNIC - company that manages/creates domain names
        Next layer down: internet layer (IP - internet protocal) (an agreed-upon standard for formatting data so it can be accepted by many devices)
        Bottom layer: physical path (i.e. massive wired connection of cell towers)

    You have to go through lots of routers connected to each other to get to a server
    TTL (time to live)
        maximum of connections before a packet is thrown away is 255
