http stuff:
    client opens connection to server through port 80 (https) or 443 (http)
    server receives connection and waits for request
    client sends request
    server responds to request
    (repeat request and response as many times as necessary)

types of requests by client:
    2 main requests:
        get - request any kind of static resource
        post - send data to the web server that we don't want repeated
            (I'm going to give you data, I want you to do things with this data, but I don't want you to repeat any of this)
            i.e. email, money
    other requests:
        put - please write this file on the server for money
        delete - delete things from the server

Response codes:
    info - 100s
    OK - 200s
    redirect - 300s
    don't understand - 400s (404 = file not found; 403 = access forbidden)
    derpy server errors - 500s (server is dying/crashing)
